# prompt_introduction

### Aim
Prompt engineering is a recent field focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively utilize large language models (LLMs) in various applications and research areas. It enhances understanding of LLM capabilities and limitations. Researchers employ prompt engineering to enhance LLM performance on diverse tasks like question answering, summarization, Information Extraction and arithmetic reasoning. Developers leverage prompt engineering to design efficient prompting techniques that interact with LLMs and other tools.
